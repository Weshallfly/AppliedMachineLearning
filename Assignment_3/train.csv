think able attend wg meeting san jose thursday mar like spend time morning getting know attendee interest experience making internet measurement suggest good way would group give short minute response time get even interesting need able see traffic one direction client server get fairly accurate round trip time client server irrespective far away client measurement host tcp three way handshake connection establishment see opening syn wait client ack server syn ack client server round trip time think actually already done could also potentially try correlate dns query tcp connection perhaps determining probability given environment host initiating tcp connection host received record track various application level response time personally love lot data ratio dns response time tcp transfer time http connection even measurement make attempt discern constitutes web transaction user full page usually many tcp connection anyway think fairly interesting thing measure simple technique simple one may interesting thing could digging payload highly utilized application tcp nightmare perfomance wise basic infrastructure thing dns udp probably cover open udp protocol without incurring performance penalty would make completely unusable snmp example application limited network service provider would find round trip time information snmp packet network management station agent useful think rudimentary thing tcp well also think site would interested rudimentary information example weighted traffic round trip time distribution tcp traffic network communicated say granularity give site notion close talk frequently little work could probably make reasonable bandwidth estimate every end network see tcp data could certainly get reasonable number maximum observed bandwidth method also decouple measurement traffic know value think significant active probers run host decoupled actual measurement timestamps coming kernel space bpf thinking long time eventually like skitter tool able use tcp packet probing need thing like ip firewall code properly time non blocking connects count passive tool see syn syn ack use tcp port round trip time measurement trick kernel sending tcp packet raw socket need feedback passive tool tracing like skitter need know reply seen hop destination reached difficult simple bytestream oriented ipc sufficient going like idea proposed others maybe funded point tracking instrumenting freenix tcp ip stack lot useful information could pulled stack eventually someone going come piece information desirable enough someone want stack instrumented somewhere currently implemented full blown metering system like rtfm think interim lot thing could using libpcap local machine non promiscuous user space safe easy implement test benefit user likely tangible well understood relationship workstation understood particularly true u network expertise least plausible find correlation measurement user experience fairly short period time helping u hone useful even find weak correlation whatever reason correlation exists people interested helping development something use personally essentially guaranteed see traffic direction

real option theory dilemma ranging valuing biotechnology product deciding whether kill internet financial service business talk rob jameson whether theoretical approach risky decision making really help business day day balancing risk reward yann hold ph degree engineering economic system department stanford university studied apply engineering decision design analysis wider economic social business issue worked consultant applying decision analysis methodology problem included consumer decision making innovative product electrical vehicle joining team partner written widely application real option particularly field life science technology e business special interest relationship risk assessment validation risk data financial valuation would sum approach business decision analytics project set help business face massive uncertainty kind decision analysis help people explore problem redesign decision making process increase chance making right choice example imagine biotechnology company decide whether put sale enter strategic relationship continue go alone option lead value enhancing value destroying scenario work client firstly understand challenge assumption associated likely business development scenario secondly help identify decision would help protect increase value technology company quantifying technical regulatory commercial risk sometimes challenge technology intensive field however found manager often scientist quite willing describe main source risk ass probability risky event may may occur kind risky decision making relate real option valuation say value asset decide might use mean form opinion value asset must explore important decision likely face significant impact value asset decision analysis help define business problem uncover stream inter related choice effect real option example company trying decide whether invest risky project option pull plug investment early stage pilot project give poor showing real option reduces riskiness increase potential value original business plan real option decision analysis really close one another believe real option valuation find decision analysis useful mean often decision analysis help manager identify key risk strategic decision attach weight show clearly interact many company risk discovery valuable part exercise real option theory criticised recently well realistic practical approach valuation important hold unrealistic hope real option approach valuation exciting methodology also sometimes reasonable way tackling practical problem example firm sell asset firm might make independent valuation asset legal corporate governance reason many business today asset simply valued traditional way difficult link cashflows cashflows might exist business novel might hidden respect real option analysis much closer reality traditional valuation exactly classic way valuing future business base calculation single discounted cashflow projected activity really take account way scenario change fact manager react situation unfold mentioned earlier option kill project business early point upside pilot project yield exciting result might allow invest quickly reach revenue generating position much shorter time original business plan allows value future business really need look cashflows might arise number scenario realistic project get green light bet manager taking kind decision ground time challenging part mapping decision analysis tree modelling link variable decision tree something particular strength also tricky know worthwhile add detail better draw back recent erisk interview rick buy chief risk officer enron said two year enron experimented real option concept found limited zero use slight air cynicism real option business today strange enron would profess attitude year ago widely reported used real option valuation support profitable purchase decision apparently bought cheaply older generator u generated electricity high cost knew could mothball year switch electricity price sufficiently high nevertheless customer point view might much hype methodology one problem application real option technology perhaps many people trying tweak reality conform perfect model better aim something pragmatic clearly improves decision time one pharmaceutical company worked recently worked together improve valuation analysis moving single discounted cash flow methodology one took account rather small set business scenario would shocked academic consultant undeniable improvement original approach think financial institution picking field applied energy industry year might something relative stability banking world recently relatively high margin banking line enjoyed also industry energy pharmaceutical tend people engineering science background dynamic modelling decision based methodology originally dreamed help engineer design electrical electronic system approach quite distinct black scholes option analysis banking world familiar black scholes approach difficult apply real option context everything depends assumption put black scholes model real option approach hand sense way modelling assumption explicitly bank adopting thinking particularly term using decision analysis pinpoint risk identify value enhancing decision using real option methodology sort wheat chaff speculative investment mean internet investment recently worked major dutch bank arrived late internet game made considerable number investment even b b business model question mark hanging many b c business already water wanted work investment might contain real value situation case ranking priority helping bank make sense could turn decision making chaos rather sophisticated valuation case whether internet investment killed problem whether continued funding take priority budget demand major upgrade existing business practical question answered somehow area financial institution seem accessible approach yes example think help work value associated various approach marketing new bank business line moment many bank chasing high net worth individual always clear kind individual particular bank decide pursue bank might regional industry advantage already one particular area example music business people churn rate associated kind customer profitability associated customer segment time cost benefit advantage bank sector outweigh disadvantage weighing kind complex problem one thing lead depends another decision real option analysis good way rigorously backtesting validating real option valuation honesty really problem time option exercised many variable surrounding changed difficult compare original analysis thing turn however value analysis come final number value asset x also providing thorough process outsider point view understanding source value short bit clearer thinking real option important rarely cited communication shareholder equity analyst battle still convince company use real option valuation significant part internal analysis even major company oil gas pharmaceutical sector idea taken root internally seems lot reluctance use external communication working analyst understand better need move thing next step riskiness business term major strategic dilemma face relate share value capital structure big question related work colleague optimal debt equity capital structure gearing corporation turn arises likely revenue cost volatility business volatile business le gearing sustain higher cost capital work touch sense exercising many specific real option allow firm change
